Welcome to RT/NTS, a high-performance, lightweight news transit server.
This file describes how to build, install and configure RT/NTS.

In case of bugs, questions, comments: mail river@RT.UK.EU.ORG.

Requirements
============

RT/NTS requires the following software:

* A reasonable modern Unix environment
* Oracle Berkeley DB (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/berkeleydb/overview/index.html)
* libev (http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html)

Building
========

RT/NTS uses GNU autoconf, the de-facto standard configuration system for
Unix sources.  To build NTS, use something like this:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

NTS will try to find the location of libev and Berkeley DB automaticaly, but you
may need to specify these explicitly, e.g.:

	$ CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include/ev"				\
	  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/pkg/lib -R/usr/pkg/lib			\
		-L/usr/pkg/lib/ev -R/usr/pkg/lib/ev"			\
	  ./configure --with-db-include-dir=/usr/pkg/include/db4

Configuration
=============

After 'make install', NTS will install a sample nts.conf.example.  Copy this to
nts.conf, edit it as appropriate, and start NTS:

	$ /usr/local/sbin/nts

In the source directory you will find 'rc.bsd', a sample init script for BSD
systems.  To use this, copy it to /etc/rc.d/nts, and edit rc.conf:

	nts=YES
	# If you chroot NTS, the init script expects the PID file to be
	# at ${nts_chroot}/pid.
	nts_chroot=/srv/nts

You can then start and stop NTS like any other service.

There is currently no init script for System V-style systems (e.g. Solaris
or Linux); please contribute one.
